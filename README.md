# TimesavingScripts
A collection of scripts made to help me save time.

== AMFP ==
A simple script that helps you sort .ARW files from .JPG wherever you place the script.
It creates two folders inside the folders where its working, one meant for sales and one for the raw files.
it also has the option to copy files into the folders where its working. Script makes .Flag files to avoid accidentaly 
sorting and creating folders twice during the work process (its a pain to sort afterwards on bigger projects).

How to use:
- Place the Script where you have folders containing .ARW and .JPG files that needs to be sorted.
- Run the script
